- ðŸ”„ BLE GATT connection (framework ready)

### Completed Development Tasks
âœ… ufbt build environment configured
âœ… govee_control FAP application structure
âœ… H6006 device driver implementation
âœ… UI framework with view dispatcher
âœ… BLE scanner module (mock for testing)
âœ… BLE connection module with keepalive
âœ… Successfully compiled FAP file
âœ… Code quality infrastructure setup
  - clang-format for consistent code style
  - clang-tidy for static analysis (LLVM 20.1.8)
  - cppcheck for bug detection
  - Automated check.sh script for all linters
âœ… Critical bug fixes
  - Fixed null pointer dereferences
  - Added proper memory allocation error handling
  - Improved resource cleanup on error paths

### Next Steps
1. **Real BLE Implementation**
   - Implement GAP scanning with Flipper BLE API
   - Add GATT service discovery
   - Connect to actual H6006 devices

2. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Test with physical H6006 bulb
   - Validate packet structure
   - Refine UI based on device feedback

### Blockers
None identified

### Key Decisions Made
- Architecture: Modular design with Device Abstraction Layer
- Protocol: Direct BLE communication (no cloud dependency)
- UI: Native Flipper Zero interface
- Scope: Focus on Govee BLE devices initially
- Multi-device: Support 5+ simultaneous connections

### Technical Specifications Summary
- **Target Platform**: Flipper Zero
- **Communication**: Bluetooth Low Energy (4.2+)
- **Memory Budget**: <256KB RAM, <1MB storage
- **Performance Target**: <100ms command latency
- **Battery Impact**: <10% per hour active use

### Supported Devices (Planned)
- H6006 - Smart A19 LED Bulb (RGBWW)
- H6160 - LED Strip Lights
- H6163 - LED Strip Lights Pro
- H6104 - LED TV Backlight
- H6110 - Smart Bulb
- H6135 - Smart Light Bar
- H6159 - Gaming Light Panels
- H6195 - Immersion Light Strip

### Risk Status
ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk Areas**:
- BLE stack limitations (mitigation: connection pooling)
- Protocol changes (mitigation: modular drivers)
- Memory constraints (mitigation: efficient data structures)

ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk Areas**:
- UI/UX implementation
- Basic functionality
- Storage management

### Team Notes
- PRD created with comprehensive specifications
- Ready for development phase
- No blockers for Phase 1 implementation
