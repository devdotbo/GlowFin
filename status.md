# Project Status

## Flipper Zero Bluetooth Govee Smart LED Controller

### Current Phase
**Planning & Requirements** - PRD & Technical Spec Complete

### Overall Progress
ðŸŸ¢ Requirements Definition: 100%  
ðŸŸ¡ Technical Design: 100%  
âšª Development: 0%  
âšª Testing: 0%  
ðŸŸ¡ Documentation: 40%  

### Completed Items
âœ… Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Executive summary and vision
- Problem statement and opportunity analysis
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- User interface design and mockups
- Technical architecture planning
- BLE protocol documentation
- Implementation roadmap
- Risk analysis
- Success metrics

âœ… Technical Implementation Document
- Complete BLE protocol specifications with H6006 support
- Flipper Zero SDK setup and FAP structure
- Core implementation with code examples
- Multi-device synchronization design
- Scene and effect engine architecture
- Model compatibility matrix
- Agent-optimized specifications

### In Progress
ðŸ”„ None - Awaiting development phase kickoff

### Next Steps
1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Configure Flipper Zero SDK
   - Set up build toolchain
   - Create project structure

2. **Phase 1 Implementation** (Weeks 1-3)
   - BLE scanner implementation
   - Basic device connection
   - Simple on/off control
   - Device listing UI
   - Configuration storage

### Blockers
None identified

### Key Decisions Made
- Architecture: Modular design with Device Abstraction Layer
- Protocol: Direct BLE communication (no cloud dependency)
- UI: Native Flipper Zero interface
- Scope: Focus on Govee BLE devices initially
- Multi-device: Support 5+ simultaneous connections

### Technical Specifications Summary
- **Target Platform**: Flipper Zero
- **Communication**: Bluetooth Low Energy (4.2+)
- **Memory Budget**: <256KB RAM, <1MB storage
- **Performance Target**: <100ms command latency
- **Battery Impact**: <10% per hour active use

### Supported Devices (Planned)
- H6006 - Smart A19 LED Bulb (RGBWW)
- H6160 - LED Strip Lights
- H6163 - LED Strip Lights Pro
- H6104 - LED TV Backlight
- H6110 - Smart Bulb
- H6135 - Smart Light Bar
- H6159 - Gaming Light Panels
- H6195 - Immersion Light Strip

### Risk Status
ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk Areas**:
- BLE stack limitations (mitigation: connection pooling)
- Protocol changes (mitigation: modular drivers)
- Memory constraints (mitigation: efficient data structures)

ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk Areas**:
- UI/UX implementation
- Basic functionality
- Storage management

### Team Notes
- PRD created with comprehensive specifications
- Ready for development phase
- No blockers for Phase 1 implementation
